					<h2>Intro jQuery</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>Why does it exist?</h3>
						Three reasons:
							It just gives us "syntactical sugar".
							It used to be about cross browser compatibility but that is largely a non issue now (so really just one reason)
							It's so popular that it has a virality effect (we teach b/c it's so popular)

					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>How much additional behavior does it add to the browser?</h3>
						none; it works within the constraints of what the browser API can do for us.
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Library or framework? Why?</h3>
						Library, explain the difference (keep in mind they haven't seen a framework yet most likely).
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>What is $ or jQuery in code exactly? How does it work?</h3>
						Use DevTools to check it out. Might want to research this a bit
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>jQuery vs jQueryUI</h3>
						speak to this
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Why is it important to learn / use jQuery ?</h3>
						Because of its prevalence. Just take a look at the top libs in https://libscore.com/#libs
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Expectations of You</h3>
					The jQuery docs are quite good, you should be using them a lot
					The API has alternative ways of doing things (eg .on('click') vs click()) and you should not get hung up on learning the entire surface area for jQuery. The goal is to learn it enough and get comfortable with the process of learning it (yes, this is a recurring theme!)
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Event handling with jQuery</h3>
					Demo binding a click event and what comes with it
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Element creation with jQuery</h3>
					Demo creating elements and inserting into DOM
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Bring event and dom creation together</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Alternatives?</h3>
