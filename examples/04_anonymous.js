function() {
  console.log("Hi, I am function!");
}

// Why do mad? I just wanted to make a function?
// We could assign this to a variable and run it, but where's the fun in that?

// Refactor as

// function logResult(fn) {
//
// }

// Now we call this with our anonymous function, used as a callback!
